  <h4>Assignment Description</h4>
  <p> Together with some of your students, prepare a proposal for an exciting, engaging, interesting, amazing presentation of the most important person in your life - you.<br>
    <br>
    The assignment must be done in groups of 5 students.<br>
    You must prepare a presentation per. group. This means that the presentation must be the group’s common concept for the presentation of all students in the group.<br>
    <br>
    Groups can choose different structures: There may be a “front page” (depending on selected media) for everyone in the group and then have individual “subpages” or make completely mixed presentation. <br>
    You can use a digital or offline media to present the idea. <br>
    <br>
    Your presentation is expected to use design elements: <br>
    • Select items <br>
    • Images Graphics Fonts Colors <br>
    • Organize your items <br>
    • Develop layout from concept </p>

  <h4>The process</h4>
  <p> The group decided that for this project, we would create a cartoon of ourself by using the bitmoji app.
<br><br>
We all downloaded the app and tried to create the most likely figure of ourself. 
<br><br>
Afterward we collected a collage with the bitmoji and other pictures that tells something about one’s self.
<br><br>
Togehter with that we assembled a powerpoint whereas we told different facts about ourself. </p>
