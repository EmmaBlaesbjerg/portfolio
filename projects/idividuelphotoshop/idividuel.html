	<h4>Assignment Description</h4>
  
  <p>
	You must select at least one photo from the series of images taken during the excursion. The image / images do not have to be one of the ones you have taken.<br><br>

	The image / images must be processed in Photoshop so that at least the following are done:<br><br>

	Remove an item: Something on the image must be removed and the background (hole behind) must be filled out to fit the image.<br><br>
	Add an item: Something that was not originally in the picture should be inserted so it appears that it was from the start.<br><br>
	Adjust the image’s lighting conditions or add a mood to the image by filter or color tone
	Cropping and possibly alignment (vertical / horizontal) of image.<br><br>
	Format and size: The image should be in 4: 3 format and saved as the size is ≦ 1 M pixel<br><br>
	Post the original, unedited image as thumbnail (max 200 pixels for the longest page) in the same record as your edited version.

	<h4>The process</h4>
 	<p> 
		
	The image builds on several changes. <br><br>

	The first step I did, was to alter the sky. To do that I found another image of a sky, which had some more colours.<br>
	After that did I remove different elements, that seemed out of places. <br><br>

	In addition to the sky, I added other elements - the moon, the flamingos and new people. <br>

	Finally, I changed the brightness and format of the imange.   <br>
