	<h4>Assignment Description</h4>
  
  <p>
	Look around! Here are bridges, - a lot of bridges. <br>And each and every one has a story that you’ll find and document with your cameras, whether it is SLR, Lomo or mobile phone. <br><br>Take beautiful pictures, ugly pictures, make sketches and drawings, find stones, leaves, vandalism and decay.
	  <br><br>
	Where is your favorite bridge? What is the story?
	<br><br>
	You can join the pictures yourself or you can not help.
	<br><br>
	Dokument and show, your gruops day and findings via your picutres.

	<h4>The process</h4>
 	<p> 
		My gruop startede the task by each finding a picture, we took on our trip into photoshop. 
		<br><br>
		Each of us changede the colour and some removed some elements.
		<br><br>
		After that we collected them all in a collage.
		<br><br>
		To conclude we inserted the text to give the image a punctuation and make people stop and fill in the rest of the sentence itself
