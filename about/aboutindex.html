  <p>Hi, I’m Emma.</p>
  <p>I’m currently a student, studying multimedia design in Denmark.<br>
    I guess for us to connect, I’ve got to tell you a little bit about me.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>I’ve always loved the idea of creating art, long before I stumbled upon multimedia design. It all started with art classes in the zoo when I was younger, until I discovered another media to express myself.</p>
  <p>Capturing and creating beautiful pieces is the most important part of my work. I fell strongly about making art that tells a story to the viewer, making them linger for a little while.</p>
  <p>There is no suprise that art is a strong passion of mine, but traveling is also the blood in my veins. I’m endlessly inspired by nature and adventures. I love waking up to new horizons, observe new cultures and exploring the world.</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>I love helping people by creating any type of art, so if you think that my art is a good fit for you, don’t hesitate to contact me, and if you would love to know more about me, what are you waiting for? </p>
